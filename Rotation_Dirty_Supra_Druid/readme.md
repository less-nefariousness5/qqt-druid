# RotationSpiritborn_Dirty

## Custom Spell Priority

The priority of spells can be adjusted by changing the sequence in spell_priority.lua file. Spells listed earlier in the sequence have higher priority. To modify the spell priority:

1. Open the spell_priority.lua file.
2. Reorder the entries in `spell_priority` list to match your desired priority.
3. Save the file.
4. Reload the script (Default: F5).

Note: This also reorders the spells in the UI. So you can check in-game if the priority is correct. If a spell is not visible, make sure the the name is correctly spelled and in the list.
